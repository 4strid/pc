Installation guide

   From ArchWiki
   [11]Jump to navigation [12]Jump to search

   This document is a guide for installing [13]Arch Linux from the live system booted with the official installation image. Before installing, it would be advised
   to view the [14]FAQ. For conventions used in this document, see [15]Help:Reading. In particular, code examples may contain placeholders (formatted in italics)
   that must be replaced manually.

   For more detailed instructions, see the respective [16]ArchWiki articles or the various programs' [17]man pages, both linked from this guide. For interactive
   help, the [18]IRC channel and the [19]forums are also available.

   Arch Linux should run on any [20]x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum of 512 MiB RAM. A basic installation with all packages from the [21]base group should
   take less than 800 MiB of disk space. As the installation process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide assumes a working internet
   connection is available.

Pre-installation

   The installation media and their [48]GnuPG signatures can be acquired from the [49]Download page.

Verify signature

   It is recommended to verify the image signature before use, especially when downloading from an HTTP mirror, where downloads are generally prone to be
   intercepted to [50]serve malicious images.

   On a system with [51]GnuPG installed, do this by downloading the PGP signature (under Checksums) to the ISO directory, and [52]verifying it with:

$ gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig

   Alternatively, from an existing Arch Linux installation run:

$ pacman-key -v archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig

   Note:
     * The signature itself could be manipulated if it is downloaded from a mirror site, instead of from [53]archlinux.org as above. In this case, ensure that the
       public key, which is used to decode the signature, is signed by another, trustworthy key. The gpg command will output the fingerprint of the public key.
     * Another method to verify the authenticity of the signature is to ensure that the public key's fingerprint is identical to the key fingerprint of the
       [54]Arch Linux developer who signed the ISO-file. See [55]Wikipedia:Public-key cryptography for more information on the public-key process to authenticate
       keys.

Boot the live environment

   The live environment can be booted from a [56]USB flash drive, an [57]optical disc or a network with [58]PXE. For alternative means of installation, see
   [59]Category:Installation process.

     * Pointing the current boot device to a drive containing the Arch installation media is typically achieved by pressing a key during the [60]POST phase, as
       indicated on the splash screen. Refer to your motherboard's manual for details.
     * When the Arch menu appears, select Boot Arch Linux and press Enter to enter the installation environment.
     * See [61]README.bootparams for a list of [62]boot parameters, and [63]packages.x86_64 for a list of included packages.
     * You will be logged in on the first [64]virtual console as the root user, and presented with a [65]Zsh shell prompt.

   To switch to a different console--for example, to view this guide with [66]ELinks alongside the installation--use the Alt+arrow [67]shortcut. To [68]edit
   configuration files, [69]nano, [70]vi and [71]vim are available.

Set the keyboard layout

   The default [72]console keymap is [73]US. Available layouts can be listed with:

# ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz

   To modify the layout, append a corresponding file name to [74]loadkeys(1), omitting path and file extension. For example, to set a [75]German keyboard layout:

# loadkeys de-latin1

   [76]Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ and can likewise be set with [77]setfont(8).

Verify the boot mode

   If UEFI mode is enabled on an [78]UEFI motherboard, [79]Archiso will [80]boot Arch Linux accordingly via [81]systemd-boot. To verify this, list the [82]efivars
   directory:

# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

   If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in [83]BIOS or CSM mode. Refer to your motherboard's manual for details.

Connect to the internet

   To set up a network connection, go through the following steps:

     * Ensure your [84]network interface is listed and enabled, for example with [85]ip-link(8):
# ip link
     * Connect to the network. Plug in the Ethernet cable or [86]connect to the wireless LAN.
     * Configure your network connection:
          + [87]Static IP address
          + Dynamic IP address: use [88]DHCP.

                Note: The installation image enables [89]dhcpcd (dhcpcd@interface.service) for [90]wired network devices on boot.

     * The connection may be verified with [91]ping:
# ping archlinux.org

Update the system clock

   Use [92]timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:

# timedatectl set-ntp true

   To check the service status, use timedatectl status.

Partition the disks

   When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a [93]block device such as /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0n1. To identify these devices, use [94]lsblk or
   fdisk.

# fdisk -l

   Results ending in rom, loop or airoot may be ignored.

   The following [95]partitions are required for a chosen device:

     * One partition for the root directory /.
     * If [96]UEFI is enabled, an [97]EFI system partition.

   If you want to create any stacked block devices for [98]LVM, [99]system encryption or [100]RAID, do it now.

Example layouts

                                  BIOS with [101]MBR
        Mount point      Partition    [102]Partition type        Suggested size
   /mnt                  /dev/sdX1 Linux                     Remainder of the device
   [SWAP]                /dev/sdX2 Linux swap                More than 512 MiB
                                  UEFI with [103]GPT
        Mount point      Partition    [104]Partition type        Suggested size
   /mnt/boot or /mnt/efi /dev/sdX1 [105]EFI system partition 260-512 MiB
   /mnt                  /dev/sdX2 Linux x86-64 root (/)     Remainder of the device
   [SWAP]                /dev/sdX3 Linux swap                More than 512 MiB

   See also [106]Partitioning#Example layouts.

   Note:
     * Use [107]fdisk or [108]parted to modify partition tables, for example fdisk /dev/sdX.
     * [109]Swap space can be set on a [110]swap file for file systems supporting it.

Format the partitions

   Once the partitions have been created, each must be formatted with an appropriate [111]file system. For example, if the root partition is on /dev/sdX1 and will
   contain the ext4 file system, run:

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1

   If you created a partition for swap, initialize it with mkswap:

# mkswap /dev/sdX2
# swapon /dev/sdX2

   See [112]File systems#Create a file system for details.

Mount the file systems

   [113]Mount the file system on the root partition to /mnt, for example:

# mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt

   Create any remaining mount points (such as /mnt/efi) and mount their corresponding partitions.

   [114]genfstab will later detect mounted file systems and swap space.

Installation

Select the mirrors

   Packages to be installed must be downloaded from [115]mirror servers, which are defined in /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist. On the live system, all mirrors are
   enabled, and sorted by their synchronization status and speed at the time the installation image was created.

   The higher a mirror is placed in the list, the more priority it is given when downloading a package. You may want to edit the file accordingly, and move the
   geographically closest mirrors to the top of the list, although other criteria should be taken into account.

   This file will later be copied to the new system by pacstrap, so it is worth getting right.

Install the base packages

   Use the [116]pacstrap script to install the [117]base package group:

# pacstrap /mnt base

   This group does not include all tools from the live installation, such as [118]btrfs-progs or specific wireless firmware; see [119]packages.x86_64 for
   comparison.

   To [120]install packages and other groups such as [121]base-devel, append the names to pacstrap (space separated) or to individual [122]pacman commands after
   the [123]#Chroot step.

Configure the system

Fstab

   Generate an [124]fstab file (use -U or -L to define by [125]UUID or labels, respectively):

# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

   Check the resulting file in /mnt/etc/fstab afterwards, and edit it in case of errors.

Chroot

   [126]Change root into the new system:

# arch-chroot /mnt

Time zone

   Set the [127]time zone:

# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

   Run [128]hwclock(8) to generate /etc/adjtime:

# hwclock --systohc

   This command assumes the hardware clock is set to [129]UTC. See [130]System time#Time standard for details.

Localization

   Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed [131]locales in /etc/locale.gen, and generate them with:

# locale-gen

   Create the [132]locale.conf(5) file, and set the LANG [133]variable accordingly:

/etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

   If you [134]set the keyboard layout, make the changes persistent in [135]vconsole.conf(5):

/etc/vconsole.conf
KEYMAP=de-latin1

Network configuration

   Create the [136]hostname file:

/etc/hostname
myhostname

   Add matching entries to [137]hosts(5):

/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
127.0.1.1       myhostname.localdomain  myhostname

   If the system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of 127.0.1.1.

   Complete the [138]network configuration for the newly installed environment.

Initramfs

   Creating a new initramfs is usually not required, because [139]mkinitcpio was run on installation of the [140]linux package with pacstrap.

   For [141]LVM, [142]system encryption or [143]RAID, modify [144]mkinitcpio.conf(5) and recreate the initramfs image:

# mkinitcpio -p linux

Root password

   Set the root [145]password:

# passwd

Boot loader

   Choose and install a Linux-capable [146]boot loader. If you have an Intel or AMD CPU, enable [147]microcode updates in addition.

Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+d.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt: this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with [148]fuser(1).

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove the installation
   media and then login into the new system with the root account.

Post-installation

   See [149]General recommendations for system management directions and post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user interface, sound or a
   touchpad).
