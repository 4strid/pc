       Pattern Matching

       Any  character  that  appears  in a pattern, other than the special pattern
       characters described below, matches itself.   The  NUL  character  may  not
       occur  in  a  pattern.   A  backslash  escapes the following character; the
       escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern charac‐
       ters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

              *      Matches  any  string,  including  the  null string.  When the
                     globstar shell option is enabled, and * is used in a pathname
                     expansion  context,  two adjacent *s used as a single pattern
                     will match all files and zero or more directories and  subdi‐
                     rectories.   If  followed  by a /, two adjacent *s will match
                     only directories and subdirectories.
              ?      Matches any single character.
              [...]  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of  char‐
                     acters  separated by a hyphen denotes a _____ __________; any
                     character that falls between those two characters, inclusive,
                     using  the  current locale's collating sequence and character
                     set, is matched.  If the first character following the [ is a
                     !   or  a  ^ then any character not enclosed is matched.  The
                     sorting order of characters in range  expressions  is  deter‐
                     mined  by the current locale and the values of the LC_COLLATE
                     or LC_ALL shell variables, if set.  To obtain the traditional
                     interpretation  of  range expressions, where [a-d] is equiva‐
                     lent to [abcd], set value of the LC_ALL shell variable to  C,
                     or  enable  the  globasciiranges  shell  option.   A - may be
                     matched by including it as the first or last character in the
                     set.  A ] may be matched by including it as the first charac‐
                     ter in the set.

                     Within [ and ], _________ _______ can be specified using  the
                     syntax [:_____:], where _____ is one of the following classes
                     defined in the POSIX standard:
                     alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower  print  punct
                     space upper word xdigit
                     A  character  class  matches  any character belonging to that
                     class.  The word character class matches letters, digits, and
                     the character _.

                     Within  [  and ], an ___________ _____ can be specified using
                     the syntax [=_=], which matches all characters with the  same
                     collation  weight  (as  defined by the current locale) as the
                     character _.

                     Within [ and ], the syntax [.______.] matches  the  collating
                     symbol ______.

       If  the  extglob  shell  option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several
       extended pattern matching  operators  are  recognized.   In  the  following
       description,  a ____________ is a list of one or more patterns separated by
       a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of  the  following
       sub-patterns:

              ?(____________)
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
              *(____________)
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
              +(____________)
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
              @(____________)
                     Matches one of the given patterns
              !(____________)
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns

   Quote Removal
       After  the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters
       \, ', and " that did not result  from  one  of  the  above  expansions  are
       removed.
