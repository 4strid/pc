When the Moon will shed no light
With the Equinox close by
In the dark a spellware rise
Riding on a lightning strike

Made of circuit boards and bytes
Forged to cross our space and time
Thru the storm my soul will guide
To the path for glory and might

Now just take some of your time
While we share this ritual night
There's a secret gift that hides
But won't come without a fight

First you need to get the rhyme
When here comes the darkest night
Then you take the first 8 bytes
Count the pins and normalize

Once you got the numbers right
Just beware the odds are lies
Line them in a row and write
That will put the code in sight

Now don't stress and take your time
Sometimes words can trick your mind
For in ASCII code you'll find
The solution to these rhyme
